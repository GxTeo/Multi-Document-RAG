# Multi-Document Retriever and Reader (RAG) Model

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a multi-document Retriever and Reader (RAG) model. The RAG model is a fusion of the retrieval-based and generative approaches to question answering. It retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and uses them to generate an answer to a given question.

## Features
- **Multi-Document Retrieval**: The model is capable of retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus, enabling it to handle complex queries that require information from multiple sources.
- **Generative Question Answering**: The model generates detailed and accurate answers to questions, leveraging the information retrieved from multiple documents.
- **Scalability**: The model is designed to be scalable and can handle large corpora and complex queries.

## Applications
The RAG model can be used in a variety of applications, including but not limited to:
- **Information Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant information from a large corpus based on a given query.
- **Question Answering**: Generate detailed and accurate answers to complex questions that require information from multiple documents.
- **Document Summarization**: Generate a summary of multiple documents based on a given query.
